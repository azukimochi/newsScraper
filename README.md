# News Scraper

This is an online web application that allows users to scrape headlines from the New York Times.  In addition to scraping headlines, users are able to save their desired articles as well attach notes to the articles.  Overall, it was built with CRUD in mind: 

**- CREATE:** Users can scrape headlines, add the headlines to the MongoDB database, and add notes.
**- READ:** Users can filter for their saved articles and any unsaved scraped articles.  Users can also read their saved notes. 
**- UPDATE:** Users can edit their the notes that are saved to articles.
**- DELETE:** Users can delete saved articles.

The technologies used in this application's creation include: JavaScript, jQuery, MongoDB, Node.js, Cheerio.js, NPM, Handlebars, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.  Heroku was used to deploy the application as well as to connect it to a remote MongoDB database (via the add-on called mLab or otherwise known as MongoLab).
